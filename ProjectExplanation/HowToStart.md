# How To Start

***WARNING***: The application is based on Electron framework and Node.js. And to make the application small and fluent, I'd like encourage all  contributors to use only Node.js and Electron APIs, or the application is not so *"Muslim"*.

## cli

Use 'yarn' in this project.

```shell
npm install yarn --global # to install yarn
yarn install electron --save # to install electron
yarn init # to initialize the project
yarn start # to debug the applicaion
```
